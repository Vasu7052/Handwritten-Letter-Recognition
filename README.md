# Recognizing Hand-written Letters/Alphabets

This is a computer program implementing a neural network that learns to recognize handwritten letters. This program uses both OpenCV and Deep Learning. OpenCv is used for drawing the letters on the screen and my trained model is used for predicting the letter ut of the drawing.

# Libraries used :
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Keras
4. TensorFlow
5. OpenCV-Python

# Working Demo

Here is the working demo of the program.
